Macroalgae Cultivation Modeling System

Offshore macroalgal farming has potential to become a thriving marine biomass industry. MACMODS is a computational framework to design, optimize, site and evaluate this nascent industry.

The United States has the worldâ€™s largest marine Exclusive Economic Zone and has the potential to build and grow a thriving marine biomass industry for the production of fuels, chemicals, feed, and food. But, in order to assess the possibility of offshore cultivation, aquaculture needs an improved set of tools for locating optimal macroalgal farm sites, evaluating farm designs, assessing new macroalgal cultivation techniques to maximize productivity, and for predicting the influence of cultivation on coastal ecosystems.

Since 2018, a team of University of California scientists have been working alongside aquaculture industry partners and the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) to develop a modeling tool to design, optimize, site, and evaluate the sustainability of large-scale offshore macroalgal farms.
